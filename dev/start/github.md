# Forking & Cloning Intersect

## Downloading Github Desktop
Github store code repositories, keeps track of code changes, allows code history to be viewed, facilitates collaboration through sharing code modifications and more. It is a developers best friend and even if you're not familiar with git already we highly recommend diving in and learning what it's all about.

To get started, [create a Github account](https://github.com/join).

Then download the [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) application.

Once installed the Github desktop application will have you sign into your Github account, you should go ahead and do that now.

Once signed in, you can hit File -> Options and under the Appearance tab there is an option for dark mode if preferred.


## Forking Intersect
Forking is a term that basically means to copy a code repository. When you fork Intersect you will have a complete copy of the entire Intersect source code repository on your own Github account.

To create your fork browse to our [Github repo](https://github.com/AscensionGameDev/Intersect-Engine) and hit the fork button.

When done you will have your own copy of the Intersect repo that remains linked to the offical repository so that later you can pull official updates into your code base or even submit a reset to contribute your code back to the base engine.

## Cloning Intersect
The last step is to clone your Intersect code repository onto your computer. Now that you've installed Github desktop and forked the Intersect repo this is really easy.

In Github desktop hit File -> Clone Respoitory

Then select your Intersect-Engine repository and select where you'd like Github to place the source. Finally hit clone.

Once the respository has cloned you can click the history tab to see the most recent code changes. The entire Intersect development history is available to browse.

If you navigate to the folder you cloned to, you will see Intersects source ready for you to dive into.

All the setup is now done! The next step is opening the code in visual studio and compiling it for the first time!
