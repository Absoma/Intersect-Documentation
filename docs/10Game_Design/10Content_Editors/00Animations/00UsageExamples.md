## Creating an animation.

See this animation.
![Animation 1](http://www.ascensiongamedev.com/resources/filehost/f39470a7cd9a34c26355f11f2b68c87d.gif)

Let's learn how to do it in the Animation Editor.

### Settings Value
First you have the image that makes up this animation.
![Animation 1](http://www.ascensiongamedev.com/resources/filehost/49d3dd7ca4e03bac91ac51fa9d7a6f02.png)

This image has the size 512x512.
Notice how many pictures there are on the horizontal and vertical lines.
4 image in both, that is, if we will go divide the image, each one has dimensions of 128x128.
It is important to know this, we already fill 2 things "Graphic Horizontal Frames" and "Graphic vertical Frames".
As previously stated - Graphic Frame Count = Graphic Horizontal Frame multiplied by Graphic Vertical Frame. Then 16. Look:

When you create a new animation and select the image, it will appear. Do not be scared, every time they appear disorganized. Put the previously cited values and you will see that the image fits.

PS: Graphic Frame Count, in the image is at 12. When above says 16.
The correct one is 16. There will be images that the multiplication will not be correct, since the multiplication is for the TOTAL frame count. So if an animation comes this way:
![Example 1](http://www.ascensiongamedev.com/resources/filehost/bbe513b8c31ff0300bc85ba0f8a7c4d5.png)
You should count how many frames there are for the animation to work perfectly (In this example, the multiplication will result in 15, but the total is 11), values above the total frames will make the animation last longer and this may or may not cause you problems, even if the problem is small.

Now run the animation. Is ready.
If you want to increase or decrease the speed of the animation, simply change the values in Frame Duration.
If you want to insert light. Just add the values and use the dark simulation next to the animation name to see how everything works.

> The light editor adds a light to each frame in the animation, meaning you can make the light "follow" the animation if you find it necessary.

Be adventurous.
