 - Offset X and Y - Will move the beam of light out of the center. In the X axis positive values to move to the right and negatives to move to the left. In the Y axis positive values to move down and negative to move up.
 - Color - Lets you change the color of the light within the map or animation.
 - For Intensity, size and amt. Just add values. Images will explain their functions better than words could explain.

>The light editor appears for map editing in the "lights" section and is embedded in the animation edition.
In the animation edition light will be added for **each frame**, make sure that you have added light to all the frames or the light of your animation may not come out as expected.
