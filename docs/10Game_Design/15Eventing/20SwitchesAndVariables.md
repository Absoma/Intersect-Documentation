*Switches and Variables* are tools to be used with Events and Common Events. Once created in this Editor, you can alter their values in the *Event Editor*.

Switch or Variable Type
---------------------------

This is where you select what type of Switch or Variable you want to make.

- *Player Switches* are simple True or False values tied to each player seperately. This can be used in various situations such as if a player has unlocked that pesky dungeon door or not.
- *Player Variables* are simple integer based values tied to each player seperately.
- *Global Switches* are simple True or False values tied to the game world. If a Global Switch is turned on, it's going to be turned on for everyone.
- *Global Variables* are simple integer based values tied to the game world. If a Global Variable is set to 5, it's going to be 5 for everyone.


You can create a new Switch or Variable by selecting the type you wish to create and clicking **New**. Double clicking the Variable or Switch in your list will allow you to rename it. This helps organize your Switches and Variables.
