## About
Intersect is free and modern 2D MMORPG Maker. This engine was designed by developers active with similar engines of the past including Eclipse, Elysium, Mirage, and Xtremeworlds. Those engines have stopped receiving updates, their framework is nearly 2 decades old, and their support communities have died out. Intersect is our attempt to bring back the classic orpg elements from those engines with a modern code base and an extremely user friendly environment. More infomration about Intersect is listed below. If you're ready to give Intersect a try then [click here to get started!](05Getting_Started/00DownloadingandInstalling.md)

Intersects editor uses various 3rd party libraries including DockPanelSuite with dozens of Win32 API calls which does not allow it to be ran on other operating systems. These libraries play a key role in making Intersect user friendly which is why we are not and likely never will pursue cross platform compatability with the editor program.



## Licensing & Cost (100% Free!)
You are allowed to create games with Intersect and distribute, sell, or otherwise make money off your games for free. Intersect is split into 3 major components which are the Game Client (MIT), the Editor (GPL) and the Server (GPL).

The only reason we have slightly more restrictive licensing on our Editor and Server components is so that we can dissuade other developers from selling our engine without disclosing their source changes.
